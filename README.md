# Subnet Calculator

This is an old project of mine made in March 2024 when Von told me that we should make a subnet calculator for our Networking 1 as doing so will allow us to automate the entire process and not have to worry about it when we are going to take the SBA.

Capabilities:
- Subnet a network based on the required amount of subnets
- VLSM calculation

Currently missing:
- Subnet a network based on the required amount of hosts (different from VLSM)
